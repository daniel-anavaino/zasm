# Developer Notes 
A running list of things that need to be addressed but don't qualify for issue status.

## Editing
* Uses the arrow keys and EDIT to move around and to enter/exit edit mode (respectively) but the comments haven't been updated to reflect that.
* Doesn't ignore "bad" keys.

## Test
At the point that unit testing needs to be added. Would be nice to have a scripted way of regressing these on the emulator.

## Current Work
* Opcode diassembler
* Z80 emulator
